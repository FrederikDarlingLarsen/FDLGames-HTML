<p>Congratulations! You found my secret page. </p>
  
<p> During my time at university, I started learning to code using Processing. When building this website
  I played around a bit with p5.js and made a small pong game called "Axis Pong" which can be played below.</p>

   <p>It is a one player game where you control both paddles at the same time. The paddle on the left is controlled by moving the mouse up and down, while
     the seond paddle is moved by moving the mouse left to right. Points are scored every time the ball hits a paddle, and you lose a life if the ball is
     lost. If all lives are lost it is "Game Over".
