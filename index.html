<h2>Lumberjack Samurai (NGJ22)</h2>

<div class="container"><iframe class="youTube" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/67cPFdghtG0" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>

<p> This game was created at the Nordic Game Jam 2022. The theme was "theme garden" meaning that everyone 
  had differnt themes determined by paper flowers that had to be chosen. The themes were divided into 
  categories by the color of the flowers. We decided to pick the category "mechanic" and picked the theme
  "cutting". This led to an idea about a samurai cutting trees.</p>

<p>Since this game was made in less than 48 hours the gameplay is not that varied. I spent a lot of time
  getting the cutting of the meshes to work and the script for randomly generating most of the game elements. The
  game was made in a team of three people which all had designated roles. I was the Lead Programmer, and the other two
  were responsible for the assets and the UI.
