   control RollerBoy through vibrant and colorful levels and will be 
   challenged to master six differnt game genres to be able to win. 
   Within each world the player is exposed to new mehanics, with some of 
   them being very familair while some others may not. Each world is its 
   own genre of play and each world have a unique twist as well. </p>

   beat your time score in arcade mode. With arcade mode, some replay value is added
