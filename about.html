<h1>About me</h1>
<img class="left" src="images/darling.jpg" alt="Picture of Frederik"   width="500" height="500">
<p>Hi, my name is Frederik Darling and i make games. I have been making games for more than 10 years with 
  my first game being made in GameMaker, before i knew anything about programming or any game design theory. 
  Most of those games were not very good.
</p>
<p>
  I was very fortunate to attend a technical highschoole from 2015-2018 where Game Design was the focus. This meant 
  that i was both prepared for higher education in general while learning a bit about making games. This was when i started 
  To familirize myself with the Unity game engine, and slowly learned to code along the way. I was not very good at coding in 
  the beginning but i got better when i entered university.
</p>
<p>
  When i studied medialogy from 2019-2022 at Aalborg University in Copenhagen, i improved my coding skills significantly and 
  the semester projects very a significant improvement from other proects i had worked on before.
</p>
