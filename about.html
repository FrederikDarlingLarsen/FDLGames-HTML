<p>Hi, my name is Frederik Darling and I make games. I have been making games for more than 10 years with 
  my first games being made in GameMaker, before I knew anything about programming or any game design theory. 
</p>
<p>
  I was very fortunate to attend a technical highschool from 2015-2018 where Game Design was the focus. This meant 
  that I was both prepared for higher education in general while learning a bit about making games. This was when I began 
  to familiarize myself with the Unity game engine, and slowly learned to code along the way.
</p>
<p>
  When I studied medialogy from 2019-2022 at Aalborg University in Copenhagen, I improved my coding skills significantly 
  when play around with <a a href="p5jsTest.html">Processing</a> and 
  the semester projects were a significant improvement from other projects I had worked on before and gave me alot more experience with Unity.
</p>

<p>Check out my portfolio using this site or take a look at my itch.io site or YouTube page to see what a have worked on over the years.
