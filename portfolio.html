<p>This is my portfolio featuring some of the more interesting projects that i have worked on. When I looked through all of
  the projects i have done over the years I figured out that I had to curate a lot and not iclude everything since i have worked
  on more than 30 projects in the last 10+ years. Below are some of my more recent projects, both the ones done at university and 
  the ones that were created as personal projects with some them made at game jams.

    <h2>Chipping Into Society (2019)</h2>
    <div class="container"><iframe class="youTube" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/UEYpVFQbumc"></iframe></div>
      <p> This was my semester project on the first semester of medialogy.
      The project was about microchipping and how this techology might
      become relevant in the future and that it would therefore be a good 
      idea to research the attitudes of the public regarding the injection
      and use of injected microchips in humans.</p>

    <p>For this project an interactive movie was created. This movie which can be seen 
      on the embedded YouTube video on the right, centers around a guy trying to get into 
      University in time for class. During this journey he will have to make a choice as to 
      whether he wants to use in injected chip or more traditional means to get on the bus, get 
      into university and grab a coffee before class.
    </p>

      <p>An interactive movie was created using Processing which was also the
      the software used when learning to code on the first semester of
      medialogy. From that programming course and this project I improved my coding 
      skills significantly. I was also the perosn mainly responsible for the code in this project 
      while also starring in the interactive movie.

    <h2>A Brief History of Air Pollution (2020)</h2>
    <div class="container"><iframe class="youTube" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/_cJxkFBQUKc"></iframe></div>
    <p>This prototype was created as a part of my second semester project at medialogy. 
    This was the first project at university that I worked on where we utilzed the 
    Unity Engine. This was an engine i had experience with before, so this meant that i 
    sort of became mainly responsible for everything Unity related in the project. This
    meant that I worked on a lot on the Unity scenes, compiling all the assets</p>

    <p>The prototype centered around the history of air pollution, to illustrate how 
    the levels of air pollution has steadily decreased over the past 70 years, in order 
    to communicate how intiaitives on an international level have helped reduce air pollution
    over time.
    </p>

    <p>Since this prototype was developed during the COVID-19 pandemic we were not able 
    to test on any participants physically. Instead the tests were conducted online. This is
    where the use of WebGL along with GitHub Pages came in handy. We were able to use Zoom and other
    online meeting software along with putting the prototype on the webpage.
    </p>
    <p></p>

    <h2>D&D using Image Processing (2020)</h2>
    <div class="container"><iframe class="youTube" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/H6TnSHjdOZY"></iframe></div>
    <p>This was the project developed on my third semester studing mediology. 
      The inspiration for the project came form Dungeons and Dragons and desire to
      mkae the setting up of a game signicanly easier. During this semester there
      was a large focus on computer vision and specifically image processing, 
      which had to be integrated into the project somehow</p>

      <p>The prototpye was capable of the detecting a grid of any size, and then also detect,
        differnt colored obejcts of the grid which could be either indicating parts of the environment, 
        or players. This made it possible to instantly recrate a digital veriosn of a D&D board
        based on a handdrawn one. Some of the inpsiration also came from the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, 
        which is why a digital version of a D&D board would be even more useful due to the increased interest
        in online solutions during the pandemic.
      </p>
      <p>The prototype was developed using Java along with JavaFX for the visuals and UI and the OpenCV
         library for the image processing. During development i was responsible for the image proccesing
         part of the game wihle others worked on the visuals and UI. Working alot with image processing also
         resulted in me learning a lot about the subject and scoring a high grade(12/A) at the Exam for that course.

    <h2>Making a Museum Alive (2021)</h2>
    <div class="container"><iframe class="youTube" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/WnhKPBkXxqM"></iframe></div>
    <p>  For my fourth semester project on AAU studing mediology, the main focus was on
      sound and music and we decied to utilaze AR technolgy as well. The aim of the
      project and prototype was to develop an application for the Danish Music Museum,
      in order to increase interst in the museum by incresing interactn at the museum.</p>

      <p>The protype which was deveopled for Android phones, lets the user scan two diffent 
        markers that would be lcated at the displays of two differn instruments. Whn csannnign
         a marker a digital version of the correspoinding instrument would the appear in the app 
         and the user would then be able to interact with said instrument. A demonstartion vidoe
         can be seen in the enbedded video n the right.</p>

      <p>When developing this prototype a was mainly responsible for the sound in the prototype. Since I
        play guitar in my spare time and had previous experience with working with sound, this was a natural fit. A lot
        of differnt techniques where explored but some were simeple noes where settled on in the end, like pitch shifting a single
        note form the GuZheng instrument in order to create thr different notes.

    <h2>Chiseling The Story: Adaptive Storytelling</h2>
    <div class="container"><img class="portfolio" src="images/portfolioImages/greek.PNG" alt="p5" ></div>
    <p> On my fifth semester studing medialogy, the focus of the semester was maily on 
      visuals ans shaders, so this was a project where a lot of effort was put into 
      the creation of 3D models. This was also the first semester project where a regular
      3D unity project was created, with my 2nd semester project beeing in 2D and the 4th
      semester project utilizing AR technology.</p>

   <p>The aim of the project was to test whether an experience utilizing adaptive storytelling would
      increase engagement for the participants as oposed to a more planned and linear experince.
      The prototype centered around greek mythology, and the everday life of the greek people. A day
      and night cycle was alos implemented with the player being albe to learn differnt things about
      greek mythology depending on the time of day.
   </p>

   <p>When developing the prototype is was responsible for the imlentation of the day and 
      night cycle along with he voice over. I was also voicing the narrator in the game. I also workedon some 
      of the 3D models along with working on an adaptive text system that would change what players where
      shown depending on whether they where interested in a story or not.
    </p>
    <p></p>

    <h2>Ancient Storytelling: Increasing Reading Engagement</h2>
    <div class="container"><img class="portfolio" src="images/portfolioImages/med6project.png" alt="p5" ></div>
    <p>This was the semester project on my sixth and final semester of my bachelors degree at medialogy. The idea behind this project
      was to create an interactive version of an ancient story used in Danish High Schools for the "fag oldtidskundsab". This would then be used
      instead of the regular text as homework to prepare the students for their next class. The larger purpose for the project was
      to increase reading engagement among high school students in Denmark, since danish youth are seriously lacking behind other OECD countries
      in reading capabilites.
    </p>

      <p>The story presented in this interactive experience, is the first story from Herodot, which is about the King Kandaules and his Queen. 
        The story is about how Kandaules' guard Gyges is forced by Kandaules to get look at his wife naked, in order to afirm how beutiful she is. The queen "finds this out"
        and then presents Gyges with the dielmma of either murdering the king to become the new king and marry the queen or otherwise to be killed
        immediately. He chooses to be king and the oracle of delphi decides that he indeed is the true king but that in "femte led" he vill be avenged.
      </p>

      <p>The experince was created with the Unity Engine. The player has to find different items pertaining to the sory in order to unlock different
         freeze frame scenarios that tell parts of the story. The freeze frames consist of human ghost-like characters in differnt poses that represent
         the characters in the story along with various props. A voice over is also implemented to supbelment the text that is presented in the freeze frames.
         The voice over system was reused from our previous project "Chiseling The Story".

    <h2>Dwaynedyana Jones and the Damn Snake</h2>
    <div class="container"><img class="portfolio" src="images/portfolioImages/indy.png" alt="p5"></div>
    <p>This was an animation that was created as a part of a mini project on a
      course call Rendering and Animation Techniques on my fifth semster studing
      medialogy. The animation had to fulfil certain requirements, like featung a rigged
      charcter with a walk cycle, hand animations and facials animations. Snkae animations
      were also encouraged.</p>

      <p>This was my semester project on the first semester of meidalogy.
      The project was about microchipping and how this techology might
      become relevant in the future and that it would therefore be a good 
      idea to research the attitudes of the public regarding the injection
      and use of injected microchips in humans</p>

      <p>The animation was done in Blender and I learned quite a lot from this minipject, both in terms
        of medloing, animations,shadng and rendering. Spending alot of the time on this animation alos 
       ended up paying off when a won an award for "Best Humor" at the M3 Awards, and award show put on 
       by fellow mediology students.

    <h2>ECO-Frog</h2>
    <div class="container"><img class="portfolio" width="800" height="450" src="images/portfolioImages/froggame.png" alt="p5"></div>
    <p>This game was developed on the Game Design course i took on the sixth semester of medialogy. It was
      made by a group consisting of me and two other students. Most of the code was written by me and I also designed the levels.
      One group member worked of the frog model, anmations and controls, while another worked on UI and sound.
    </p>

      <p>Since the theme on the course was to create either an ECO game or a game that would somehow promote the 17 UN
        sustainabillty goals, we decided to create a game about a frog the would collect trash while on the journey to
        deliver a message to humans about the sad state of his forest. An intersting mechanic implemented for this game was the controls.
        Instead of using tranitaional WASD controls the player would instead have to click on the sceen in the direction they wanted the frog 
        to jump and hold the mouse button the charge the jump.
      </p>

      <p>The game was creted in the Unity engine, and working on this project was another change to practice working with this, which i at this 
        point had gotten very familiar with. The final game was very much based on some early "quick and dirty" prototypes that i put together in
         a couple of days, so I found that working with the Unity Engine had become quite easy, compared to when a started worknig 
         with it some years ago.

    <h2>RollerBoy (2023)</h2>
    <div class="container"><img class="portfolio"  src="images/portfolioImages/final3.PNG" alt="roller"></div>
    <p>I started developing this game when i was still studing at university, but I had to 
      wait untill i finished my degree to have time to complete the game. During develipment, the
      core gamelay of the game have changed quite a lot at the future plans for development are very differnt
      than they were just a few months ago (written on march 2022).</p>

    <p>They game centers around a rolling ball character called RollerBoy. He has to complete many differnt varied
      levels i order to win. Every world that RollerBoy goes through is a new genre of play, which means that every
      type of player will be challenged at some point and thta only true gamers will do well in the game.
    </p>

    <p>The plan is to release the maybe sometime in 2023, this depends on alot of vairables and the game might have to
      be pushed further. The game will be released on Steam when it is time, more information will be shared when development
      is progressing.
    </p>
    <p></p>
    <p>The game can be played by clicking "play RollerBoy" or by clicking on this link: <a href="rollerboy.html">RollerBoy Demo</a></p>
    <p>The game can also be found on itch.io following this link: <a href="https://frededarling42.itch.io/">RollerBoy itch.io page</a></p>

    <h2>Candy Shoot (2021)</h2>
    <div class="container"><iframe class="youTube" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Xs41Dxso4k0"></iframe></div>
    <p>This game was developed by me and a friend at a halloween game jam a AAU CPH in 2021. 
      The aim of the game was simple to make a fun halloween inspired shooter with lots of
      candy. The game was placed third in the category of Fun to Play, wihch was also the category
      we were going for this time around.</p>

    <p>In the game you wield a very cool halloween decorated deagle and you have to shoot appraching bats and 
      spiders in the dark, foggy and scary forest. When the enemies are shot candy is spread out fron them and
      scattered everywhere, the player must then to to collect as much of the candy as possible while continung to shoot
      the enemies.  
    </p>

      <p>This game was done in less than 48 hours but i still managed to learn lot in process, i was responsible for all of
        the code and unity related stuff while my frind created the models. I learned about the unty nav meash system for the
        enies along with implementing smooth turning for them. A also worked with parts of the environment working with volumetric fog. 
        A more complete verison of the game is planned for a steam release by haloween this year. It will be an exteneded version of the
        game jam game and it will be a free to play title.

    <h2>Star Tours 1987 VR (2021)</h2>
    <div class="container"><img class="portfolio"  src="images/portfolioImages/star tours.PNG" alt="star tours"></div>
    <p> DISCLAIMER: This is a Fan Project that will never be released due to copyright reasons. </p>

    <p>This is a Star Wars/Disneyland inspired fan projetct that a spent some itme working on due
      To my large interst in disney parks, star wars and the start tours ride in Disneyland specifically. 
      The point of the project which i am still working on is the recreate the original version of the 
      Star Tours Ride which has now been replaced by a new version of th ride in all of the disney parks.
    </p>

    <p>The project is created for VR since the plan is the make it a very immersive experince where the user
      will be able to feel like they are experiencing the original Star Tours ride in real life. Alot of effort
      was out into restoring the video shown inside the StarSpeeder 300 wihch was restored using deep learning AI
      upscaling sofware of video from differnt sources. some sources were very shaky requies alot of editng in
     Davinci Resolve mostly focusing on image stabilization.
    </p>

      <p>The main ride part of the project is alomst finished by could use some graphical updates. The paln now is
         the recrate te queue and maybe the outside area, along with implementing decent VR movement controls that
         do not cause motion sickness. Another plan to make the experice even more immersive is to implement 
         it with the Yaw VR motion simulator.
    </p>

    <h2>Chad Game (2021)</h2>
    <div class="container"><img class="portfolio" src="images/portfolioImages/chad1.png" alt="chad game"></div>
    <p>This game was made at a small online game jam that functioned as a test for possible 
      bigger game jams at AAU. I worked on this game with one of my firend and it was made 
      in less than 48 hours.</p>

    <p>
      The game focused a lot on story and text. The game centers around the Virgin who wants to be like Chad. 
      He figures out through out the game that there are three things he needs to do... When he has achieved
      all of this he will win at life.
    </p>

    <p>
      The game was not successful in accomplishing the most intersting gameplay, but i was a good learning process
      for the implementation of a basic text sytem and for at payer controller tat could move the player i 8 directions.
    </p>

    <h2>Turbo Cow (2018)</h2>
    <div class="container"><iframe class="youTube" width="800" height="450" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/1NarQksEx0M"></iframe></div>
    <p>I attended a game jam at Vallekilde Højskole() in Holbæk in 2018 with some friends. We
      did not reasise unitl we got there that almost all attendants were professional game developers,
      which meant that we got to see the working progress of differnt indie game while we worked on our own game.
      This jam lasted a bit longer than the usual 48 hours, which means that we go to spend more time making a game
      that was much better than what we had done on other jams.
    </p>

    <p>
      The game is a racing game, with procurally generated chunks of race track, where the player has to keep racing, 
      endless runner style in order to best the high score. The idea was to create a very stylixed game utilixing the 
      at the time relatively new HDRP(High Definition Render Pipeline) in Unity. We settled on a synthwave style game, 
      with a soundtrack to match. One intersting feture that was added was to be able to play the game in synth maode or
      8 bit mode. The would change the stlye of the music and a filter would be added to the screen in 8-bit to make it
      look like and old CRT monitor.
    </p>
  
    <p>
      For this game I worked primarily on the sound fx an the muisc. I got to play around with LMMS for the music. 
      We had some conversations about releasing the game on Steam, and chipped in a Steam direct page for the release. We
      never got to finish the game though, due to the three of us being busy with life stuff.
