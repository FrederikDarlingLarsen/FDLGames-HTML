<p>This is my portfolio featuring some of the more interesting projects that i have worked on. When I looked through all of
  the projects i have done over the years I figured that had to curate a lot and not iclude everything since i have worked
  on more than 30 projects in the last 10+ years. Below are some of my more recent projects, both the ones done at university and 
  the one that were created as personal projects with some them made at game jams.

    <h2>Chipping Into Society (2019)</h2>
    <p><iframe width="800" height="450" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/UEYpVFQbumc"></iframe>
      This was my semester project on the first semester of meidalogy.
      The project was about microchipping and how this techology might
      become relevant in the future and that it would therefore be a good 
      idea to research the attitudes of the public regarding the injection
      and use of injected microchips in humans</p>

    <p>For this project an interactive movie was created. This movie which can be seen 
      on the embedded YouTube video on the right, centers around a guy trying to get to 
      University in time for class. During this journey he will have to make a choice as to 
      whether he wants to use in injected chip or more tradinal means to get on the bus, get 
      into university and grab a coffee before class.
    </p>

      <p>An interactive movie was created using Processing which was also the
      the software used when learning to code on the first semester when a studied
      medialogy. From that programming course and this project I improved my coding 
      skills significantly. I was also the perosn mainly resposlbe for the code i this project 
      whie also starring in the interactive movie.

    <h2>A Brief History of Air Pollution (2020)</h2>
    <p><iframe width="800" height="450" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/_cJxkFBQUKc"></iframe>
    This prototype was created as a part of my second semester project at mediology. 
    This was the first project at university that I worked on where we utilzed the 
    Unity Engine. This was an engine i had experience with before, so this meant that i 
    sort of became mainly responsble for evertything Unity related in the project. this
    meant that i worked on a lot on the unity scenes, compiling all the elements</p>

    <p>The prototype centered around the history of air pollution, to illustrate how 
    the levels of air pollution has steadily decread over the past 70 years, in order 
    to communicate how intiaitives on an international level have helped reduce air pollution
    over time.
    </p>

    <p>Since this prototype was developed during the COVID-19 pandemic we were not able 
    to test on any participants physically. Instead the tests were conducted online. This is
    where the use of WebGL along with GitHub Pages came in handy. We were able to use Zoom and other
    online metting software along with putting the prototype on the webpage.
    </p>
    <p></p>
    <p>A link to play the game on the WebGL page can be found here: <a href="https://frederikdarling.github.io/P2WebGL/">this is link</a></p>
